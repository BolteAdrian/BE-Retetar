In the Culinary Manager and Inventory application, we opted for the use of a relational database, specifically Microsoft SQL Server. 
During the process of creating this database, we aimed to represent the data in the simplest and most intuitive way possible, while maintaining accessible names for tables and fields. 
This application's database comprises a total of 8 tables, each playing a distinct role in the functioning and organization of the application:

- **Settings** – managing application settings
- **RecipeIngredients** – managing ingredients used in recipes
- **RecipeCategories** – organizing recipe categories
- **Recipe** – storing and managing the recipes themselves
- **PreparedRecipeHistory** – history of prepared recipes
- **IngredientQuantities** – managing quantities of ingredients used
- **Ingredient** – managing details about each ingredient
- **Category** – organizing categories of recipes and ingredients
